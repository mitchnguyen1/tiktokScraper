TikTok Video Scraper
This is a Node.js script that uses Puppeteer to scrape TikTok videos from a user's profile page and save the scraped data to a JSON file. The script is designed to run in non-headless mode, meaning that a browser window will be opened and controlled by Puppeteer during execution.
